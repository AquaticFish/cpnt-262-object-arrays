  **Notes:** 
Array find and array filter is very similar basically, it Loops through the listed items Until it meets the dictated requirements.

  const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

  const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);

  console.log(found);
  // Expected output: 12

Here it's asking for the element to be greater than 10 so eliminate 5 and 8 but how come it It shows 12, rather than 130 and 44? and it's because of its placement, Because it's Loops in the order it shows 12 is the first one that reads the requirements and it completely stops it's looping. Filter is basically just like this but it comes out as an array.

How pop() and (pop) vary from one another. In essence, (pop) returns the element it removed whereas (pop) removes the last element.

  **Self-Assessments:** 
I feel more confident and comfortable with objects and arrays, I Would give myself a good solid 8.5 out of 10, I can decently explain what I did but I might have to search up to an occasion and I'm not probably using proper term.
